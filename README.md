# Exact Camera Location via Gauss–Newton Method

``Summary``

This project work aimed to develop an algorithm under the name of Gauss–Newton’s
method to determine inverse problems leading to an optimization of least squares solutions.
The linkage of the theoretical results made with a real-world problem where the
main goal was about to find an exact camera location from a photo that had been taken in
the past.
